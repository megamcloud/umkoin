Umkoin Core integration/staging tree
====================================

What is Umkoin?
---------------

Umkoin is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Umkoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Umkoin Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

Umkoin is a direct derivative of Bitcoin, a popular experimental digital
currency.
